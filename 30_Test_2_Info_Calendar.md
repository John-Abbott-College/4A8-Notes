# **Test 2 Info**

### **Reminder: as indicated in the course outline Evaluation Plan, to pass the course, you must get >= 60% on cumulative tests.**



#### Access Modifiers in C#

- public, protected internal, protected, internal, private protected, private 
  - Scope of each
- Why do you want to always limit to the most restrictive scope possible?
- What access modifiers make sense in classes of the HomeBudget dll
- Testing an internal class

#### Dynamic Link Library - dll

- What is it?
- Can it be executed on its own?
- Can another program use it? 
- How is it used (calling functions)
- Good to include documentation to know how to use it.
- Loaded in memory when needed.
- A single copy can be used by different programs at the same time
- Creating and using a dll in VisualStudio

#### WPF controls, layout

- Be able to add controls, set properties and event listeners
- Be able to layout controls in containers, margins, padding, alignment

#### Design patterns vs Architectural patterns

- Be able to distinguish between the two
- Advantages of using a design pattern
- Examples of design patterns.
- Advantages of using an architectural pattern.

#### MVC, MVP, MVVM

- Be able to explain the basic differences and pros/cons of each
- Does WPF imply MVVM?
- Be able to mplement the MVP pattern and how you would go about changing something in MVC into MVP in WPF.
- How to test an MVP Presenter layer

#### Combo boxes

- What should I add to my combo box? The actual object? Just the displayed string? Why?
- How to set the displayed property of an object added to the combobox

#### DataGrid

- DataGrid requires a get/set on properties that are bound to the DataGrid
- Binding
  - Can set the ItemsSource.
  - One column per bound property, one row per object in the ItemsSource
  - Automatically generates a column per property of objects
  - Can customize the columns by setting AutoGenerateColumns to false and creating columns programmatically with associated Bindings (need to know how).
  - When the ItemsSource is a List of Dictionary objects (key-value pairs), you need to bind to the indexed key value: new Binding([myKey])
- Adding a context menu

#### CI/CD

- What does it stand for, what is the goal?
- How does it fit into Agile thinking?
- How is it implemented? By automating build, integration, testing, packaging and release steps.
- What are the advantages of having these steps automated?
- Understand the parts of a CI/CD pipeline (like a GitHub Actions workflow)
  - Why did we use command-line to figure out the steps?
    - Figured out that needed to set the PATH, restore packages before building.
  - GitHub Actions
    - Script is run on GitHub servers, independently of what is on my computer's copy of the repo
    - GitHub installs a fresh OS version and clones a fresh copy of my repo from GitHub.

#### Refactoring code

- Fits with Agile
- Managers do not like it generally, but important in development
- Understand goals: go back and improve code made fragile with piled on changes, change of requirements, change of frameworks/libraries, improving separation of concerns, improve robustness.
- The longer you wait the riskier it gets to go back and refactor.
- Example: 
  - Having to bring the model namespace Budget into the UI layer. Why did we have to? What could have been done instead?



### SOME REVIEW ELEMENTS

#### Coding standards

- Donâ€™t change existing code unnecessarily
  - May unnecessarily introduce bugs
  - Causes noise, makes it more difficult to see what the intended change in the commit is, in particular if it introduces a bug
  - Always use standard indentation styles (usually spaces instead of tabs)
  - Functions/methods should do one thing and one thing only
  - Variable/method/field/class names should be meaningful
  - Avoid code duplication
    - Holding the same information in two places is increasing the likelihood of bugs - versions diverge, one may forget to update both places, etc.
- Unit tests
  - Does full code coverage necessarily imply that logic is fully tested?
- JIRA / GIT
  - What are burndown/burnup charts
  - Why is it important to set your story points before starting a sprint?
  - The master/main repository should only contain code that is deployable, why?
  - What is the purpose of a .gitignore file when creating a repository in GitHub?
    - Any generated files should be in the list of ignored files (fields that should not be tracked by Git)
