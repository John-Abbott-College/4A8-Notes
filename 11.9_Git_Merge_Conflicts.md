# Git Merge Conflicts in Visual Studio

## Definition

A merge happens when two separate branches of a git repo have changes made to the same code, and git just does not know which changes are valid.

## When do they occur?

Git tries its best to decipher changes to files, and often can distinguish between to sets of independent changes.  However, if the changes occur within the same 'chunk' (I believe git uses the bash 'diff' command to see changes), git just doesn't know which change is correct.

## Examples

6. Go back to the main branch

7. Create a new branch `branch2` from `main`
