# **Test 2 Info**

### **Reminder: as indicated in the course outline Evaluation Plan, to pass the course, you must get >= 60% on cumulative tests.**

#### Access Modifiers in C#

- public, protected internal, protected, internal, private protected, private 
  - Scope of each
- Why do you want to always limit to the most restrictive scope possible?
- What access modifiers make sense in classes of the HomeBudget dll

#### Dynamic Link Library - dll

- What is it?
- Can it be executed on its own?
- Can another program use it? 
- How is it used (calling functions)
- It is good to include documentation to know how to use it.
- It is loaded in memory when needed.
- A single copy can be used by different programs at the same time
- Be able to use a dll in a project

#### WPF controls, layout

- Be able to add controls, set properties and event listeners
- Be able to layout controls: containers, margins, padding, alignment

#### Design patterns vs Architectural patterns

- Be able to distinguish between the two
- Advantages of using a design pattern
- Examples of design patterns.
- Advantages of using an architectural pattern.

#### MVC, MVP, MVVM

- Be able to explain the basic differences and pros/cons of each. Note you do not need to know how to do MVC or MVVM explicitely. Just understand the key points about them and mostly how they differ from MVP.
- Does WPF imply MVVM?
- Be able to implement the MVP pattern and understand how you would go about changing a project to be in MVP in WPF.
- How to test an MVP Presenter layer using interfaces

#### Combo boxes

- What should I add to my combo box? The actual object? Just the displayed string? Why?
- How to set the displayed property of an object added to the combobox

#### DataGrid

- DataGrid requires a get/set on properties that are bound to the DataGrid. They must be public.
- Binding
  - Can set the ItemsSource.
  - One column is shown per bound property, one row is shown per object in the ItemsSource
  - Automatically generates a column per property of objects
  - Can customize the columns by setting AutoGenerateColumns to false and creating columns programmatically with associated Bindings (need to know how).
  - When the ItemsSource is a List of Dictionary objects (key-value pairs), you need to bind to the indexed key value: new Binding([myKey])
- Adding a context menu

#### CI/CD

- What does it stand for, what is the goal?
- How does it fit into Agile thinking?
- How is it implemented? By automating build, integration, testing, packaging and release steps.
- What are the advantages of having these steps automated?
- Understand the parts of a CI/CD pipeline (like a GitHub Actions workflow)
  - Why did we use command-line to figure out the steps?
    - Figured out that needed to set the PATH, restore packages before building.
  - GitHub Actions
    - Script is run on GitHub servers, independently of what is on my computer's copy of the repo
    - GitHub installs a fresh OS version and clones a fresh copy of my repo from GitHub, before running my script.
    - We used the suggested template script for our type of repo (WPF C# solution). In that template, there already were steps to checkout our repo and add MSBuild to the PATH on wherever GitHub is running our script.
    - We set appropriate values for the environment variables used in the script steps
    - The CICD run was set to be triggered by any commit to master, or an pull request to master.
    - The script was set up to build both the debug and release configurations of our solution. This is why we see two script runs per commit/pull request to master. 
      

#### Refactoring code

- Fits with Agile
- Managers do not like it generally, but important in development
- Understand goals: go back and improve code made fragile with piled on changes, change of requirements, change of frameworks/libraries, improving separation of concerns, improve robustness.
- The longer you wait the riskier it gets to go back and refactor.
- Example: 
  - Having to bring the model namespace Budget into the UI layer. Why did we have to? What could have been done instead?


### SOME REVIEW ELEMENTS

#### Coding standards

- Donâ€™t change existing code unnecessarily
  - May unnecessarily introduce bugs
  - Causes noise, makes it more difficult to see what the intended change in the commit is, in particular if it introduces a bug
  - Always use standard indentation styles (usually spaces instead of tabs)
  - Functions/methods should do one thing and one thing only
  - Variable/method/field/class names should be meaningful
  - Avoid code duplication
    - Holding the same information in two places is increasing the likelihood of bugs - versions diverge, one may forget to update both places, etc.
- Unit tests
  - Does full code coverage necessarily imply that logic is fully tested?
- JIRA / GIT
  - What are burndown/burnup charts
  - Why is it important to set your story points before starting a sprint?
  - The master/main repository should only contain code that is deployable, why?
  - What is the purpose of a .gitignore file when creating a repository in GitHub?
    - Any generated files should be in the list of ignored files (fields that should not be tracked by Git)
