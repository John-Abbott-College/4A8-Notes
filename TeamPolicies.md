# Team policies

Your team will have a number of responsibilities as it works on the different milestones in this course.

- **Designate a  for each milestone.** 

  You will be rotating these roles for every milestone. Role tasks are the following:

  - The coordinator checks with other team members before the meeting to remind them of when and where they will meet and what they are supposed to do. Coordinator keeps everyone on task and makes sure everyone is involved.
  - The recorder prepares the final solution to be turned in.
  - The checker double-checks it before it is handed in. Moreover, the checker makes sure everyone understands both the solution and the strategy used to get it. The Checker turns in the assignment, with the names on it of every team member who participated actively in completing it.

- **Agree on a common meeting time** and what each member should have done before the meeting.

- **Do the required individual preparation.**

- **Review returned assignments.** Make sure everyone understands why points were lost and how to correct errors.

- **Consult with your instructor** if a conflict arises that can’t be worked through by the team.

- **Team work**

  Team work is essential to this course. Developing skills around communication, responsibility and contribution towards a team endeavor is essential.

  Every group Milestone could have deductions of up to **50%** of the mark for the team work component.

  Team Work must be DEMONSTRABLE.

- **Dealing with non-cooperative team members:**

  If a team member refuses to cooperate on an assignment, his/her name should not be included on the completed work. If the problem persists, the team should meet with the instructor so that the problem can be resolved, if possible. If the problem still continues, the cooperating team members may notify the uncooperative member in writing that he/she is in danger of being fired, sending a copy of the memo to the instructor. If there is no subsequent improvement, they should notify the individual in writing (copy to the instructor) that he/she is no longer with the team. The fired student should meet with his/her instructor to discuss options. Similarly, students who are consistently doing all the work for their team may issue a warning memo that they will quit unless they start getting cooperation, and a second memo quitting the team if the cooperation is not forthcoming. Students who get fired or quit must either find another team willing to add them as a member or get zeroes for the remaining assignments.

- **Policy on absences**

  Unexcused absences of more than 20% of any of the in-class group or project integration activities will result in a grade of 0 for the assessment related to that activity.

  As you will find out, group work isn’t always easy. Team members sometimes cannot prepare for or attend group sessions because of other responsibilities, and conflicts often result from differing skills and work ethics. When teams work and communicate well, however, the benefits more than compensate for the difficulties. One way to improve the chances that a team will work well is to agree beforehand on what everyone on the team expects from everyone else. Reaching this understanding is the goal of the assignment on the Team Expectations Agreement Instructions handout.

- **Deductions**

  - Missed more than 20% of the in class time given to work on a milestone, without an important reason that is excused by your teacher: **0 on that milestone**.
  
  - Missed a team stand up meeting: - **6% for the milestone**
  
  - Various deductions for not being actively present: 
  
    - being distracted during team work time: on phone, doing work or studying for other courses, browsing other things
    - disappearing during team work time, other than for a 5 mins quick bathroom break or to get water
    - chatting with a different team when you are supposed to be working with your team
  
  - Various deductions for not contributing in an equitable way to your team's efforts
  
    - not paying attention to product owner information or feedback so that you are able to integrate them into your work
  
    - not communicating reliably and effectively outside of class
  
    - not contributing enough to design and coding efforts.
