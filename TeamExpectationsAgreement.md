# Team Expectations Agreement Instructions

- Select a team name.
- On a single sheet of paper, add your names, your team’s name, and list the rules and expectations you agree to adopt as a team.
- You can deal with any or all aspects of the responsibilities outlined in the Team Policies such as preparation for and attendance at group meetings, making sure everyone understands all the solution, communicating frankly but with respect when conflicts arise, communication methods, collaborative platform to be utilized, acceptable time limits for delays etc.
- These expectations are for your use and benefit - they won’t be graded or commented on unless you specifically ask for comments.
- Include the role assignments you made (coordinator, recorder, checker) and that you intend to rotate the roles after every milestone.
- Each team member signs the sheet, indicating acceptance of these expectations and intention to fulfill them.
- Turn one copy in to the professor, and keep the remaining copy or copies for yourselves.
