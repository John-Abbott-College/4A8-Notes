# Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs)

“Friends share all things.”  *Pythagoras*

## What is a DLL

Very briefly…

* A dll is a piece of code that cannot execute by itself
* If another program (executable) has been properly instructed to use a particular dll, the program can call functions which are coded in the dll
* A dll library will be loaded into memory when needed, and can be used by many different programs at the same time.

There is no sound track (other than the sound of clicking keys), so you can watch with the volume turned off.

The audio was giving me trouble, so I went with the silent version.

Is is slow moving, but I want to show everyone what's going on.  Watch it carefully!
