## Guidelines

Team work is essential to this course. Developing skills around communication, responsibility and contribution towards a team endeavor is essential.

Every group Milestone could have deductions of up to 50% of the mark for the team work component.



**Team Work must be DEMONSTRABLE.**



## Deductions

- Missed more than 20% of the in class time given to work on a milestone, without an important reason that is excused by your teacher: **0 on that milestone**.
- Missed a team stand up meeting: - **6% for the milestone**
- Various deductions for not being actively present: 
  - being distracted during team work time: on phone, doing work or studying for other courses, browsing other things
  - disappearing during team work time, other than for a 5 mins quick bathroom break or to get water
  - chatting with a different team when you are supposed to be working with your team
- Various deductions for not contributing in an equitable way to your team's efforts
  - not paying attention to product owner information or feedback so that you are able to integrate them into your work
  - not communicating reliably and effectively outside of class
  - not contributing enough to design and coding efforts.
