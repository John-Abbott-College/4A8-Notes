What is SQLite?

* A database
* Look into it! 
  * How is SQLite like the SQLServer database you have experience with?
  * How does it differ?	
* You could look into things such as
  * where is it installed? 
    * On a server? 
    * Locally?
  * Type of database relational or non-relational?

## Summary

* Relational - table-based
* Stored in a file
* Very lightweight - ‘at home’ database
* No configuration, no server required

## Installation

[Installation Instructions](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/)

**Keep a list of all the steps you have taken.**

* If you get stuck, you need to have the list of all the steps you have taken to help the trouble-shooting

* *Before* asking for help, verify that the list of steps you took are consistent with the instructions.

Verify that you can run sqlite from the command line!!!! You do not need to install an SQLite GUI tool.
