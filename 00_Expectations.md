# Expectations

This course is trying to mimic the *real world* as much as possible.  As such, this course should be treated as if it were a job.

Therefore...

## Attendance
* Attendance is mandatory, even on lab days.
* Marks will be lost on your milestones/assignments if you do not attend class (missing 20% of class time for an assessment will result in a 0, per the attendance policy), unless you have sufficient reason.

## Teams
* You will be grouped together in teams, and you will *not* have a choice as to whom you will work with, just as you usually do not choose your work colleagues.
  * It is possible that you may not like your teammates.  However, we expect the students to remain professional at *all* times. 
* Effort and knowledge equality
  * It is possible that you have a teammate who is not as capable as you.  That is ok, there is always a way to figure out a way to work where each person can contribute.
  * *As a team, it is necessary that all members contribute*
    * This means that if you are good at everything, that does not permit you to *do* everything.  Each team member must be given the opportunity to learn and grow.  Tutor your teammates as required.  
    * If you are not as good as your teammates, you must make all efforts to learn what you need to learn so that you can contribute effectively.
  * Every team member needs to understand the logic
    * All changes made must be code reviewed by all team members. You need to understand what was done.
    * Tests will assess everyone's knowledge.
* Problems
  * It is always possible that in spite of all your best efforts, your team is not working as well as it should.  Seek teacher guidance!!!!

## Milestones
The project is a semester long task.  However, you (the student) will be expected to complete certain tasks by a certain time.  This is called a *milestone*.
* The due dates for *milestones* are important, and not to be ignored.  There is no late policy - think of the milestones as work deliverables.

  

## Teacher Responsibility
Technology is constantly changing, and as such, the project is a bit fluid.

It is possible that the requirements for a milestone may change slightly even after it has been specified.  We (the teachers) will try to minimize this as much as possible, but make no promises.

We are here for you. If you have any issues please let us know right away.
